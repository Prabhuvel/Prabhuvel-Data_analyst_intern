# Day 2 – Pivot Table Analysis

## Objective
Analyze sales data using pivot tables and derive meaningful business insights.

## Tasks Performed
- Converted dataset into an Excel Table
- Created pivot tables:
  - Sales by Category
  - Sales by Region and Segment
- Sorted values to identify top performers
- Added slicers for interactive filtering
- Created a pivot chart for visualization
- Formatted date and currency columns appropriately

## Notes
- Profit margin analysis was not performed as the dataset does not include a Profit column.
- Minor missing values (e.g., Postal Code) were retained as they were non-critical.
