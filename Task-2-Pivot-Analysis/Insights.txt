📊 Pivot Analysis Report (Task 2)
1. Objective

The objective of this analysis is to summarize sales performance using pivot tables and interactive elements in Excel, and to derive meaningful business insights from a sales dataset.

2. Data Preparation

The dataset was reviewed for missing values.

Non-critical missing values (e.g., Postal Code) were retained without deletion.

Date fields were standardized to YYYY-MM-DD format.

Sales values were formatted as currency.

The dataset was converted into an Excel Table to support dynamic pivot analysis.

✔ This ensures data consistency and pivot reliability.

3. Pivot Table Analysis
Pivot 1: Sales by Category

A pivot table was created to aggregate total sales by product category.

Categories were sorted from highest to lowest sales.

This pivot clearly identifies the top revenue-generating category.

Business value:
Helps management understand which product categories drive the majority of revenue.

Pivot 2: Sales by Region and Segment

Sales were analyzed across Region (rows) and Customer Segment (columns).

This allows comparison of regional performance and customer type contribution.

Business value:
Highlights strong and weak regional–segment combinations for targeted strategy.

4. Interactivity (Slicers)

Slicers were added for:

Region

Category

Segment

Slicers were connected to all pivot tables and the pivot chart.

Business value:
Enables quick, interactive filtering without rebuilding reports.

5. Visualization

A Pivot Chart (Sales by Category) was added.

The chart updates dynamically based on slicer selections.

Business value:
Provides an at-a-glance visual comparison of category performance.

6. Limitations

Profit margin analysis was not performed because the dataset does not contain a Profit column.

No assumptions or artificial calculations were introduced.

✔ This is the correct and professional decision.

7. Overall Assessment of Excel Work
Strengths

Correct use of pivot tables

Proper sorting and aggregation

Clean formatting

Correct use of slicers

No unnecessary or incorrect calculations

Honest handling of missing data and limitations

Minor Improvement Areas

Could optionally add:

A time-based pivot (Sales by Year/Month), if required

Slight alignment polish for report layout (purely cosmetic)
