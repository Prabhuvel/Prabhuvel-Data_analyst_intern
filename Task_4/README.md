# Task 4: SQL Joins and Business Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this task is to demonstrate the use of SQL JOIN operations to combine data from multiple logical tables and answer business-oriented questions.

---

## Dataset
- **Dataset:** Superstore Dataset
- **Source:** CSV file imported into MySQL
- **Base Table:** `superstore`

Since the dataset is denormalized (single table), logical tables were created to represent:
- Customers
- Orders
- Products
- Sales

These logical tables were then used to perform JOIN operations.
